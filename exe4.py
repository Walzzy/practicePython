# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

def divisors(x):
    numbers = range(x,0,-1)

    for y in numbers:
        if (x%y == 0):
            return y





print(divisors(10))


x = 6
numbers = range(x,0,-1)

for x in numbers:
    print(x)
